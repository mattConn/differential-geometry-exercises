\section*{Exercise 4.1.3}

The \emph{hyperboloid of one sheet} is
$$
S = \lbrace \left( x,y,z \right) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \ \vert \ x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1  \rbrace.
$$

Show that, for every $\theta$, the straight line
$$
(x-z)cos\theta = (1-y)sin\theta,  \ (x+z)sin\theta = (1+y)cos\theta
$$

is contained in $S$, and that every point of the hyperboloid lies on one of these lines. Deduce that $S$ can be covered by a single surface patch, and hence is a surface. (Compare the case of the cylinder in Example 4.1.3.)
