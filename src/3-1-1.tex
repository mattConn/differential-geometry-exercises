\section*{Exercise 3.1.1}
Show that\\
$$ \gamma(t) \ = \ ((1+a \ cost)cost, \ (1+a \ cost)sint) $$
where $a$ is a constant, is a simple closed curve if $|a| < 1$, but that if $|a|>1$ its complement is the disjoint union of three connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$, two of which are bounded and one is unbounded.\\
What happens if $a = \pm1$?

When $|a|>1$, $\gamma$ will have a self intersection. By definition, a simple closed curve is not to have any self-intersections.\\

\noindent
\underline{Proof of self-intersection when $|a|>1$:}\\\\
\indent

For some $t_0, \ t_1 \in [0,T)$, where $\gamma$ is $T$-periodic, $\gamma$ will have the same position twice if $\gamma$ has a self-intersection. Meaning,
$$
\gamma(t_0) \ = \ \gamma(t_1)
$$
but $t_0 \neq t_1$.\\

Solving $\gamma(t_0) = \gamma(t_1)$  for $t_1$ and $t_0$, we will arrive at
$$
t_0 = cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{a}\right)
$$
$$
t_1 = 2\pi - t_0
$$

At $t_0$ and $t_1$, our position will be at the self-intersection and potential cusp of the curve if it were a cardioid; meaning, when $|a| = 1$.\\
This should prove that when $|a|>1$, $\gamma$ cannot be a simple closed curve.\\

\noindent
\underline{$\gamma$'s complement to disjoint sets $Int(\gamma)$ and $Ext(\gamma)$:}\\\\
\indent
When $|a|>1$, $\gamma$ has a self-intersection, and therefore two sets of $Int(\gamma)$, as well as a single $Ext(\gamma)$ set; these sets are disjoint and complement $\gamma$ as the union of $\sim\gamma$.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption*{$Int_2$ is disjoint from $Int_1$, which is disjoint from $Ext$.}
  \end{subfigure}
  \end{figure}
  
  We can then classify these sets as follows, starting from the inside of $\gamma$, using $t_0$ and $t_1$ from the earlier proof of self-intersection:\\\\
  $$
\forall (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2,
  $$
  $$
  Int_2(\gamma) = (x,y) < [\gamma(t_0),\gamma(t_1)]
  $$
  $$
  Int_1(\gamma) = [\gamma(t_0),\gamma(t_1)] < (x,y) < [\gamma(0),\gamma(t_0)] \cup [\gamma(t_1),\gamma(2\pi)]
  $$
    $$
  Ext(\gamma) = [\gamma(0),\gamma(2\pi)] < (x,y)
  $$
  \clearpage
These sets can be written in the following inequality:
$$
Int_2(\gamma) < Int_1(\gamma) < Ext(\gamma)
$$
and summarized as the following equation:
$$
\sim\gamma=Int_2(\gamma) \cup Int_1(\gamma) \cup Ext(\gamma)
$$

\noindent
\underline{When $|a| = 1$:}\\\\
\indent
We will officially have a limaçon when $|a| = 1$, which means that\\
$$
\gamma(t_0) \ = \ \gamma(t_1)
$$
and $t_0 = t_1$; there is no self-intersection. The point $\gamma(t_n)$ will be the cusp singularity of the cardioid where our self-intersection would be on a cardioid. This curve will be simple and closed.\\
